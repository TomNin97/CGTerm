# Computer Graphics Final Project Progress Report
## Group Members: Caleb

<p>For this final project we will be designing and implementing an interactive learning studio for computer graphics. For the learning studio, the page will display three options: Intro to WebGL and Shapes, Displaying the Shapes, and Showing Multiple Objects Together. Each option will open their own HTML page to show that corresponding category. A menu will be displayed on the side, showing all of the options, as well having a link to return to the home page. Intro to WebGL and Shapes will give a brief description of WebGL and its usage with shapes. Displaying the Shapes will show multiple options for which kind of shape, display the corresponding shape on the canvas, and have a text box explaining the various coding changes. Showing Multiple Objects Together will display the multiple objects, in both 2d and 3d, and will explain how to show multiple objects on the same canvas. Overall, the project uses HTML to open various pages, JavaScript will be used to output the shape, and everything will be outputted to WebGL.</p>
